## Usage

(Note: This runs the backend without the frontend)

**Start the backend server**:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## Testing

To test the REST API on the backend, we recommend using `Postman`. Postman is a powerful tool that allows you to send requests to your API endpoints, inspect responses, and easily manage your testing workflow.

For detailed endpoint specifications, please refer to the API documentation.

## Database

This project uses PostgreSQL. Ensure you have the database set up and running.
